# Redux Toolkit and Redux Toolkit Query example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

It shows some basic use cases for RTK:
- Fetch data with actions, async actions, using Redux Thunk;
- Handle data (query/mutation) using the entity adapter;
- Handle data (query/mutation) data with RTK query (some use cases including useQuery, useLazyQuery, useQuerySubscription + useQueryState);
- Prefetching;
- Patch data with Event Source;
- Data caching (API call optimization).

Data fetching is performed using [reqres.in](https://reqres.in/).
